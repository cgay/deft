Module: deft
Synopsis: test subcommand

// The deft test subcommand builds test libraries and runs the tests.  It uses heuristics
// on the library name to figure out which libraries are test libraries (see
// test-library-name?).

// Some workspaces (especially multi-library packages) may have both test executables
// (e.g., foo-test-app) and test shared libraries.  In that case we only run the
// executables, on the assumption that they will take care of running all the tests.
// Otherwise it could result in running some tests multiple times.  (The hope is that as
// `deft test` is used more there will be no need to create test apps at all.)

// If any test run fails `deft test` exits immediately with a failure status without
// running the tests in the remaining libraries.
