# pacman

A package manager for Dylan. (This is a library, not the name of an executable, so there
is no conflict with the `pacman` package manager for Arch Linux.)

Find, download, install, and uninstall any version of any Dylan package and its
dependencies.

It isn't normally necessary to use this library directly. See the
[dylan-tool](https://github.com/dylan-lang/dylan-tool) documentation instead.

See [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13G6I1P2v9sULeV38pjOy-5EGhJme7BDQ52jQ0gO1peM/edit?usp=sharing)
for some design discussion.
